Much of our work is ongoing across multiple repositories, so we have collected links and descriptions here:

Finite Factor Models for Interactions (FIN):

https://github.com/fedfer/factor_interactions

Chemicals often co-occur in the environment or in synthetic mixtures and as a result exposure levels can be highly correlated. We propose a latent factor joint model, which includes shared factors in both the predictor and response components while assuming conditional independence. By including a quadratic regression in the latent variables in the response component, we induce flexible dimension reduction in characterizing main effects and interactions. We propose a Bayesian approach to inference under this Factor analysis for INteractions (FIN) framework. Through appropriate modifications of the factor modeling structure, FIN can accommodate higher order interactions and multivariate outcomes.


Bayesian Sparse and Smooth Supervised Factor Analysis (bs3fa):

https://github.com/kelrenmor/bs3fa

bs3fa is a package for Bayesian sparse and smooth supervised factor analysis. This model is appropriate for data in which you observe functional Y and numeric (continuous, binary, count) data X. The model assumes all variation in Y is explained by some low-dimensional factors eta, and these factors also explain part (but not all) of the variation in X.


Bayesian Factor Analysis and Postprocessing in R:

https://github.com/poworoznek/sparse_bayesian_infinite_factor_models

Bayesian latent factor models are key tools for modelling linear structure in data and performing dimension reduction. Recent advances in prior selection allow the posterior computation of semi- and non-parametric infinite factor models. These data-informed latent spaces show significant advantages in reproducibility and robustness in comparison to frequentist methods at the cost of computationally intensive sampling. We provide a package for the R programming environment with functions for sampling from the posterior distributions of several popular and recent factor models and priors with attractive properties for a wide class of inference.
